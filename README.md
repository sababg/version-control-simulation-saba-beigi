# Git Workflow Practice

## 📌 Deliverables

This project demonstrates a basic Git workflow, including branching, merging, and conflict resolution.
The pull request process helped ensure code quality by allowing me (and others) to review changes before merging them into the main branch.

### Steps Completed

1. **Created an empty repository** on GitHub and cloned it to my local machine.  
2. Made an **initial commit** to generate the `main` branch.  
3. Created **two additional branches**, each containing different content.  
4. Added a similar footer section in both branches intentionally to **cause a merge conflict**.  
5. Merged both branches into the `main` branch and **resolved the conflict by combining the content** from both versions.  
6. Created a **new branch** dedicated to adding a `README.md` file.  
7. Opened a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge the README into the `main` branch.
